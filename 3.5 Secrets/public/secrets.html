    <h1>Secrets</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        🤫 I confidently sit down to study for one hour, open my laptop with
        full motivation, and somehow end up researching completely unrelated
        topics like “how astronauts sleep in space.”
      </li>
      <li>
        📱 I unlock my phone to reply to one important message, check Instagram
        for just a second, and suddenly 30 minutes disappear without any
        explanation.
      </li>
      <li>
        ⏰ I set multiple alarms every morning with different labels like
        “FINAL,” “SERIOUSLY WAKE UP,” and “NO EXCUSES,” yet I still manage to
        oversleep and feel surprised about it.
      </li>
      <li>
        💻 I spend hours debugging my code, questioning my skills and life
        choices, only to discover that the problem was a tiny typo I looked at
        at least twenty times.
      </li>
      <li>
        🍔 I promise myself I’ll eat healthy starting tomorrow, but the moment I
        see good food, I convince myself that today doesn’t really count anyway.
